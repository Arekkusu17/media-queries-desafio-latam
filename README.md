## Work Done
- Write the html structure and kind of sketch the layout using the design mobile first. So i first wrote the structure for mobile and the keep scaling up to desktop.    
- Start working with the media queries to keep the componentes in the shape that they are designed and style them as needed.
- Add the pagination component, i thought it was easy to work on it at the end, because they wouldnt interfere with the layout.
- Had some problemes with the grid areas chosen, so i had to fix them using the main html tag.  
- Add README.md
